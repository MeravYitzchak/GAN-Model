# GAN Model for Generating Hebrew Fonts from Manuscript Data

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model using a Colab notebook to generate new Hebrew fonts by learning from manuscript data.

## Description

This project leverages the capabilities of GANs to create unique Hebrew fonts. The model is trained on a dataset of Hebrew manuscript images, learning its style and characteristics to generate new font samples.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language.
* **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework. 
* **Keras**: High-level API. 
* **Google Colab**: Development and training environment.
* **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: Deep learning architecture for data generation.
* **OpenCV**: Image processing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of images of Hebrew manuscripts.

## Installation Instructions

1.  Open the Colab notebook `[notebook_name].ipynb` in Google Colab.
2.  Upload your dataset to Google Drive and connect it to Colab.
3.  Install the necessary packages by running the appropriate code cells in the notebook.
4.  Set the paths to your dataset in the notebook.
5.  Run the code cells to train the GAN model.

## Usage

1.  Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate new font samples by the GAN_test.ipynb file.
2.  Modify the parameters in the notebook to customize the generation process.
3.  Download the generated images.
